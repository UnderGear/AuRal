This is an Android Eclipse project I did for an REU over the 2011 Summer. It was a lot of fun, and I feel like I learned a lot from it.

I would like to give some credit, firstly.
This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant OCI-1005165.
https://github.com/glastonbridge/SuperCollider-Android/ - This is the Open Source SuperCollider Android app that AuRal REQUIRES to run without crashing.
http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/sc140/ - I transcribed a few of these for use in the app
http://www.illposed.com/software/javaosc.html - This library is used to receive OSC from the Server.

It requires Android 2.2+ and SuperCollider Android which can be found here: https://github.com/glastonbridge/SuperCollider-Android/wiki/_access

Contact me if you are having any problems with SC. There are a few tricks with setting up the projects to link together in Eclipse.
You must first put the SuperCollider app onto your device. Follow their instructions for building the NDK code, and then getting the project into Eclipse. Push it over to the device, and then go into the project's properties and set it to be a Library under the Android menu there.
To set up this project in Eclipse, first you should import it and make sure that you are using the Google SDK for Android 2.2 in Properties->Android. While you're here, add the SuperCollider project to the Libraries references at the bottom. You'll need to download Java OSC from a link above. Follow their instructions, and add the built jar to the java build path in my project. It should be at javaosc/lib/javaosc.jar


The accompanying Ruby on Rails app is a server that mediates interaction between multiple client apps. It can be found here: https://github.com/UnderGear/AuRalSite

Usage:
Change login information in Menu -> Preferences. Port 8000 is the default.

You long press on the map to create a new location. Name it, select a synth, if you're logged into a server you can send it in. Click on an existing location to modify or remove it.
Create area mode allows you to long press on the map to set vertices on a polygon. Menu -> Finalize pulls up a similar dialog to the normal creation mode.

NOTE: My SuperCollider skills are very lacking. If you actually know what you're doing with SC, feel free to contribute some synths!
